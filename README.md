This program features a basic FTP server and client program. Once the FTP server is running, the client program can open a session and run basic commands. There are 4 available commands:

1. ls - list the files in the server's directory
2. get - asks the server to send a file
3. put - send a file to the server
4. quit - close the session with the server
